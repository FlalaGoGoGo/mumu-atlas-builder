# Demo Targets (Atlas Builder)

For the HW2 demo and benchmark, we use two museums with robust public collection APIs to ensure a replicable enrichment workflow.

## Target museums
1) Art Institute of Chicago (AIC)
- museum_id: art-institute-of-chicago-us

2) The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met)
- museum_id: the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-new-york-city-us

## Rationale
- Both museums provide public APIs for collection data, enabling consistent retrieval of artwork metadata and images.
- These targets let us benchmark enrichment quality and coverage (e.g., 100 artworks + 30 exhibitions) with minimal scraping brittleness.
