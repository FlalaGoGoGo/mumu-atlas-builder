Born in Calcutta and raised in the verdant Himalayan mountains of Kashmir, Shaw draws deeply on the landscapes and memories of his early life, many of which were fractured by political upheaval. Forced to leave Kashmir as a teenager, he relocated first to New Delhi and later to London, where he studied at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design.
His work is influenced by a broad range of sources—Mughal and Persian miniatures, Renaissance altarpieces, Old Masters paintings, Japanese arts of the Momoyama period, Kashmiri and Urdu poetry, and Hindu and Western mythology—and yet his visual vocabulary and technique are all his own.",

The exhibition will present over 20 years of making, including early conceptual works that take nature and existing found objects as sources of inspiration, along with furniture, mirrors, and other products that the designer creates from appropriated and digitally manipulated Greco-Roman antiquities. Also on display will be a range of the designer’s “kinetic” cabinets, defined by their moveable elements. Errazuriz is interested in disrupting the idea that cabinets must consist of a box with two front doors, or ""exploding the box,"" as the artist describes his approach.

Gross (The Gross Clinic) is widely considered the greatest American painting ever made. At the time of its creation and for decades after, though, many deemed the work too gruesome for polite society: the incision in the thigh, the blood on the surgeons’ hands, the patient’s mother recoiling in horror. But even the squeamish critics couldn’t deny Eakins’s unparalleled mastery of composition, detail, and light and shadow.
Eakins painted The Gross Clinic for the city’s Centennial Exhibition of 1876, which drew ten million visitors. In 2007, 3,600 donors from all fifty states helped purchase the work so that it could remain in Philadelphia, to be exhibited for alternating five-year periods at the Philadelphia Art Museum and at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where Eakins studied and later taught.

Over the course of one extraordinary decade, Sargent achieved recognition by creating boldly ambitious portraits and figure paintings that pushed the boundaries of conventionality.

The Japanese word sōsaku, often translated as “creativity,” more accurately means “innovation” or “the invention of something entirely new.” This concept was largely absent from the production of ukiyo-e prints throughout the Edo period (1615–1868), in which printmaking duties such as carving, inking, and printing were delegated to specialists to maximize the craftsmanship and volume of prints designed in a predetermined, standardized style. At the beginning of the 20th century, as Japan was inundated with new Western artistic approaches such as etching, lithography, and photography, woodblock print designers needed a way to revitalize their medium. Emulating precedents in Europe and America, they demanded that modern prints (Japanese: hanga) be produced by a single artist working independently and without assistance, thereby imbuing each image with the uniqueness of a painting. 
As the leader of this printmaking revolution, Onchi explored particularly challenging territory. Inspired by avant-garde artists in the West, he produced abstract prints that addressed profound philosophical concerns: how do we depict a subject that we cannot see, such as a passage of music? If a visual artist were to draw from the same creative wellspring as the composer of a symphony, then what shape and color would best represent an emotion like sorrow or despair? Over the course of his career, Onchi invented an entire visual language in response to these questions. Some of his most enthusiastic patrons were Americans, including the Honolulu-based collectors and donors James Michener (1907–1997) and Oliver Statler (1915–2002). As a result, the Honolulu Museum of Art came to possess the largest collection of prints by Onchi outside of Japan.  
Commemorating the seventieth anniversary of the artist’s death, this retrospective is a testimony to Onchi’s enormous influence upon modern and contemporary art within Japan and beyond its borders. ",

Vivid prints of divinities are part of daily life for Hindus in India and around the world, used for worship in homes, factories, and offices, as well as for adornment on cars, calendars, computers, and shop counters. The art world has historically overlooked these images, often called “calendar art,” because they are inexpensive and mass produced. But they have a rich and fascinating history in and influence on Indian art, religion, and society.
“Divine Color: Hindu Prints from Modern Bengal” explores these popular prints’ origins and powerful impacts. When Indian artists encountered the new printmaking technology of lithography in 19th-century Calcutta (today Kolkata), then the capital of British India, they used it to reinvent devotional art. Depictions of Hindu gods became more realistic, colorful, and accessible than ever before. Shrines in homes across the economic spectrum came to host these images, mixed and matched according to a family’s taste. Though the lithographs of Hindu gods created by Bengali artists were not expensive, they were valuable in other senses. Sold in the bustling bazaars of Calcutta where presses competed to attract customers, the prints served an important role in home worship, satisfied the artistic sensibilities of a Bengali society that had absorbed European fine art values, and helped to spread new political ideas. The exhibition considers how lithography gave these artists—who produced thousands of prints that traveled quickly across the nation—a means to change not just devotional but also artistic, political, and social life.
A highlight of the exhibition is the MFA’s collection of 38 vibrant lithographs from 19th-century Calcutta. The MFA is one of only two American museums that collects this material. This exhibition, the first of its kind in the United States, features more than 100 objects, including other prints, paintings, sculpture, and textiles from the Museum’s South Asian collection and select loans. It culminates in an immersive room developed in collaboration with the Delhi-based Tasveer Ghar—an organization dedicated to collecting, digitizing, and documenting South Asian popular visual culture—featuring wall-sized collages of 20th-century popular images.",

It brings together 35 of her finest paintings from museums and private lenders across the United States and Europe alongside plant and insect specimens as well as work by other female artists, including Anna Ruysch, Maria Sibylla Merian, and Alida Withoos. Seeing these provocative juxtapositions, visitors can gain insight into the central role women played in the production of scientific knowledge in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries.
As global trade routes expanded in the 17th century, thousands of new plant specimens arrived in the Netherlands for cultivation in greenhouses and botanical gardens. Ruysch was among the first artists to introduce new species, from passionflowers to cacti, into her flower still lifes. Merging art and science, these paintings are far from just decorative; they’re riddles, hints of a deeper understanding of the natural world. They speak of survival and loss, the delicate balance between beauty and violence, and the deeper narratives of colonial expansion unfolding beneath the surface. Visitors are invited to celebrate the beauty of Ruysch’s work while discovering the hidden stories woven within.
This exhibition is organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, and the Toledo Museum of Art. Scientific content was developed in collaboration with Charles Davis, professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University.",

His luminous views transport viewers to the rugged Maine coast, the Adirondack Mountains, seaside England, sun-drenched Caribbean waters, and beyond. The MFA houses the largest collection of Homer’s watercolors in the world, though the works’ fragility and sensitivity to light means they have not been displayed together in nearly half a century.
This exhibition brings dozens of the MFA’s Homer watercolors back into the galleries for a new generation to experience, alongside a selection of related oils, drawings, and prints by the artist. With material ranging from Homer’s childhood drawings all the way to his final canvas, visitors can follow the major chapters in his career and learn about the various environments—ecological, artistic, social, and economic—that shaped his enduring work in watercolor.
Born in Boston, Homer had a long relationship with New England and the MFA, which was one of the first museums to acquire a painting by the artist, Fog Warning (1885), in 1894. The first watercolor, Leaping Trout (1889), came into the collection soon after, and over the 20th century the Museum amassed almost 50 watercolors and 11 oil paintings by Homer, creating one of the most significant collections of Homer’s work across media.",

The large-scale installation will be in the museum’s Brotman Forum, its main entrance lobby and a community space that is free to the public to enjoy without a ticket to the museum. The commission was organized by José Carlos Diaz, SAM’s Susan Brotman Deputy Director for Art.
Little Cloud Sky (2025) is composed of 40 of the artists’ signature Little Cloud character, each custom made of plastic, four feet wide, and suspended from the ceiling of the Brotman Forum. The work is designed to spread positivity and inspire a sense of connection, encouraging museum visitors to reflect on the beauty of togetherness and the power of joy and nature. While versions of this interior skyscape have been displayed in cities around the world, including Las Vegas, Miami, Tokyo, and London, this is a brand-new iteration and the artists’ first long-term museum installation.
The Little Cloud character serves as a symbol of peace and connectivity and can be found throughout the artists’ work. In August 2024, London’s Covent Garden featured Little Cloud World, an installation with 40 inflatable Little Cloud characters. In January 2024, Tokyo’s Yoyogi Park hosted Little Cloud Sky, accompanied by a large-scale parade, “The Happy Dancing Rainbow Alliance,” featuring FriendsWithYou’s iconic characters.",

By the 1520s, a new style emerged with greater narrative complexities and dramatic energy that was to be foundational for later developments. Concurrently, some artists began working in the pastel palette and with delicate motifs reinterpreted from Persian art. 
Then, around 1560, with the exuberant patronage of the third Mughal emperor Akbar (born 1542, reigned 1556–1605), artists from different parts of the empire and trained in a variety of Indian styles came together in a new imperial painting workshop. The workshop was led by Persian masters brought from the imperial court in Iran. The formation of Mughal painting shaped by Akbar’s taste for drama and realism had a lasting impact on the cultural life of India. With its naturalism and vibrant compositions, the revolutionary new style was distinct from its predecessors, both Indian and Persian. The paintings in this gallery trace the dramatic changes that occurred during the 1500s alongside compositions that artists chose to retain and reinvent. Central to this story is a manuscript of the Tuti-nama (Tales of a Parrot), an illustrated collection of fables made for Akbar around 1560–65 now in the Cleveland Museum of Art.",

Unfolding over a period of roughly 15 years, between 1868 and 1883, theirs was perhaps the closest relationship between any two members of the Impressionist circle. As friends and colleagues—by turns collaborative and competitive—they collected one another’s work. Morisot posed for some of Manet’s most compelling portraits, several of which will be on view in the first gallery of the exhibition. When she married Manet’s younger brother, their professional connection deepened into a familial bond. Thirty-six paintings and six drawings and prints borrowed from museums and private collections in the United States and Europe reveal the evolution of a singular friendship between two groundbreaking artists. Visitors will see beach and garden scenes made en plein air (out-of-doors) that demonstrate how Manet borrowed individual motifs and compositional ideas directly from Morisot. Portraits of fashionable Parisian women of the 1880s by the two artists show their different perspectives; Manet’s paintings were inspired by admiration and erotic interest while Morisot’s were informed by lived experience. The exhibition closes with a self-portrait by Morisot painted when she was in her mid-40s, revealing her perception of herself as a professional artist.

What is here? Who is here? These are the questions that internationally renowned artist Ann Hamilton asks herself at the beginning of every project in order to find the appropriate medium, form, and physical manifestation with which to respond to the site or occasion. Eight years in the making, Hamilton’s exhibition at the Cleveland Museum of Art focuses on a medium that has become increasingly important to her over the past decade—photography.
Hamilton used a handheld scanner to bring to life objects in the museum’s collection that are rarely on display: small-scale figurative ceramics and crèche figures from the 1300s to the 1800s. Her floor-to-ceiling images of the diminutive sculptures fill the walls and surround the viewer in the museum’s photography gallery. The sculptures become characters joined in a story that is hinted at but never told.
A different photographic medium—video—dominates the second of the exhibition’s two galleries, where three videos circle the walls. They ask us to consider the act of making, to explore the concept of turning in space, and to ponder the relationship between touch and language.
Born in Lima, Ohio, and living in Columbus, Hamilton is among Ohio’s most influential and best-known artists. Among her many honors are the National Medal of the Arts, the MacArthur Fellowship, the Heinz Award, and the Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship. ",

This reinterpretation of Claude Monet’s iconic triptych from the Museum of Modern Art in New York offers an equally immersive experience, merging the lush beauty of Monet’s water lilies with Ai’s personal history.
Visitors can experience this work—displayed in one long panel on a single wall—up close in an intimate gallery at the Seattle Asian Art Museum. This is the first time this work has been shown in the US; it debuted in 2023 at the Berlin art gallery neugerriemschneider.
The piece has a connection with the Seattle Art Museum’s history. An actual Monet Water Lilies work was loaned to the museum in 1956 by Walter P. Chrysler Jr., who purchased it from the Monet estate and toured it around the United States. The painting was displayed in the Fuller Garden Court of the Seattle Asian Art Museum, the original home of the Seattle Art Museum.",
